        <p>Hello! I'm Cinthia from Paraguay.

            I discovered my interest in web development with a background in graphic design and a few years of experience in the technology industry, particularly with the Ministry of Technology in my country.
            
            I'm excited to explore the dynamic world of technology and face new challenges in web development. I am passionate about creating user-friendly and visually appealing digital experiences that impact meaningfully.
            
            Outside of work, I've been happily married for three years. My husband and I love spending quality time together, mainly engaging in outdoor activities. Soccer is my favorite team sport.
            
            I look forward to starting this course and getting to know all of you as we navigate the field of web development together.
            </p>

        <p>"Paraguay is a country of big rivers, green landscapes, folklore and a rich indigenous culture in central South America. It's relatively small compared to its neighbors, with an area of 406,752 km2. There are two official languages in Paraguay: Spanish and Guarani. Asunción is the captivating capital city of Paraguay. It enchants all visitors with its mixture of colonial history and contemporary energy. Settled along the scenic Paraguay River, the city boasts an array of cultural delights, from historic landmarks like Palacio de López and Casa de la Independencia to lively markets, colorful street art, and a burgeoning culinary scene.
            With warm locals, pleasant weather, and vibrant nightlife, Paraguay invites you to delve in its dynamic and welcoming atmosphere."</p>
