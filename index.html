        <p>Hello! I'm Cinthia from Paraguay.

            I discovered my interest in web development with a background in graphic design and a few years of experience in the technology industry, particularly with the Ministry of Technology in my country.
            
            I'm excited to explore the dynamic world of technology and face new challenges in web development. I am passionate about creating user-friendly and visually appealing digital experiences that impact meaningfully.
            
            Outside of work, I've been happily married for three years. My husband and I love spending quality time together, mainly engaging in outdoor activities. Soccer is my favorite team sport.
            
            I look forward to starting this course and getting to know all of you as we navigate the field of web development together.
