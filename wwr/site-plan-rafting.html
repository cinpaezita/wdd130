            Many rafting websites focus on adrenaline-pumping adventures and lack information about family-friendly options. Kid-friendly activities and safety information are crucial for parents.
            
            Rafting websites often cater to groups or adrenaline seekers, neglecting the solo traveler seeking serenity. Information about peaceful trips and opportunities for self-reflection are key.
